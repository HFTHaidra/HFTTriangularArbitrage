# HFTTriangularArbitrage
Triangular arbitrage is used in foreign exchange trading to exploit differences in exchange rates across different markets. It involves three trades: an initial currency is exchanged for a second, the second currency for a third, and finally, the third currency back to the initial currency, ideally at a profit.
